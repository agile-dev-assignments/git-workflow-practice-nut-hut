## Interest

I found this article particularly interesting as it discusses how tech companies are still expanding physical spaces. I had the impression that most tech companies were embracing remote work as many have realized that work-from-home offers many benefits to productivity and happiness. 

## Sam's Response

I found this article very interesting too, especially where the "death of distance" is discussed. I'm already tangentially aware that brain drain in certain states--like Ohio, where I'm from (so I suppose I'm part of the issue)--exists, so the fact that despite increasing ways for remote work, companies (and people!) still want to work in person is interesting. I'm also the sort of person who prefers to work in person--going remotely has not been very kind to me--so in a way it's comforting to know that companies still plan to have office spaces.
